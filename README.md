Project Title: National Obesity Percentage Analysis
Introduction:
Obesity is a significant public health concern in the United States, affecting nearly a third of the population. The increasing prevalence of obesity can be attributed to various factors, including the proliferation of fast-food chains and sedentary lifestyles. Obesity is associated with numerous health risks, such as hypertension and various life-threatening diseases. This project aims to analyze and compare obesity percentages across different states to identify potential factors contributing to regional disparities in obesity rates.

Sorting Analysis:
The project utilizes the merge sort algorithm for sorting data due to its efficiency and low number of comparisons compared to other sorting algorithms. While insertion sort and selection sort required a higher number of comparisons, merge sort demonstrated superior efficiency with a time complexity of O(nLogn). Additionally, all sorting algorithms exhibited fast sorting speeds, with merge sort being the most efficient.

The dataset used for analysis is available here.

Thesis:
The analysis of obesity rates across the United States reveals a diverse spread of obesity percentages, with states like Colorado exhibiting the lowest rates and states like Alabama and Mississippi in the south demonstrating some of the highest rates. Overall, there appears to be a trend of higher obesity rates in the southeastern regions compared to the north. However, there are notable outliers, such as Kansas, which borders Colorado but exhibits high obesity rates.

Conclusion:
By analyzing obesity percentages and identifying factors contributing to regional disparities, this project aims to contribute to public health efforts aimed at addressing and mitigating the obesity epidemic in the United States. Identifying effective strategies and interventions based on regional differences can help improve public health outcomes nationwide.
